# Rain-in-the-Forecast Checker

This simple script checks for rain in the forecast at your current location.  By default, it is set to search
over the next six hours for forecasted rain, however, this variable can be easily changed.  This app has been
helpful for determining when to turn off outdoor electronic devices, whether manually or through automation,
so I hope you enjoy the app.

## Steps to Use
1. Obtain a free API key with [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/appid).
2. Install the required dependencies with pip.  For example, `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Edit the top three variables inside of `secrets_example.py` and then rename the file to `secrets.py` with:
`mv secrets_example.py secrets.py`.
4. Run the app with `python3 app.py` to test it out, and feel free to amend this file to your liking.

That's it!  Enjoy!
